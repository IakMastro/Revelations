Welcome to project revelations! This is a Function as a Service project made for my Thesis!

<!--truncate-->

Revelations is a **Function as a Service** (**FaaS**) platform able to create dynamic APIs based on a programming language and accompaning libraries.

It was initially developed as part of my thesis for my Master Engineer's studies in University of West Attica.

The code is fully **open source** and everybody can contribute code and put a pull request. If you want to contribute, contact me in Discord ``IakMastro#0344`` or at ``iakmastro@outlook.com.gr``
