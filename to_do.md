# PLACEHOLDER TODOs

* Integrate a message broker like Kafka to the system.
* Further, refactoring of front end to bring it to good React standards and use more components and pass more props. 
  API calls should also happen in a different file as well.
* Check if backend needs refactoring as well, especially the docker api.
* Add dynamic URLs through the use of a dotenv file.
* Potentially see if Ansible is useful for this project.
* Write English documentations and a how-to manual for users
* Finish the write-up, make more diagrams to export them as images for the final version and find free pictures on 
  the web.
* Start working with the presentation.
* Find a cool dataset to use for a Proof of Concept. Work with somebody to help you in this part!
* Ask your professors for feedback!
* Uninstall bootstrap and popperjs. (forgot to do so)
